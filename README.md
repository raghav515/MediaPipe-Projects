This Repository contains some projects that I made during my course of learning OpenCV with MediaPipe.

## Installing Discrepancies
``` python -m pip install - r requirements.txt ```

### Brief
- MediaPipe Library makes it easy for us to work with hand/face/pose detection as it has a set of pre-trained models.
- The programs that are uploaded here are beginner friendly, so even a newbie can understand it and begin his/her jounrney in the field of AI/ML/DL.
- Basic knowledge of OpenCV library is recommended. But, as said earlier it is not a compulsion.
- This repository is still incomplete, I have more to add in it.
